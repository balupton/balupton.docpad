## Contact

Use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) for technical support.

For all other intents and purposes; mention me on <Link code='twitter' />, ask me questions on <Link code='quora' />, converse with me over a <Link code='meet'>meeting</Link>, or email me via my [personal email](mailto:b@lupton.cc) and [work email](mailto:b@bevry.me) that I check once a week every Monday.

## Expectation

I cannot legally sign contracts that may risk contaminating the intellectual rights of my open-source projects. If you are unsure if your contract may, then most likely it does, as most likely your company will or already does use something I've touched. However if we can collaborate on this point to ensure it is not a problem, then great.
