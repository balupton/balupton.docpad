	<h2>I radically explore the known and the unknown.</h2>

	<h3>I help make the web awesome.</h3>

	<p>Before I die, I wish to see everyone enabled to do what they love, share their love with the entire world, and live well. This is a big calling, and I'm chipping away at it steadily.</p>

	<p>This has worked well for me so far; for several years I was the most active <%-@link('opensource')%> developer in Australia and one of the most prolific in the world; my technical projects have been used in some of the world's biggest web-sites/apps (Basecamp, Spotify, Ustream) and by some of the world's biggest companies (Microsoft, Adobe, GitHub, Atlassian), touching their millions of users; my non-technical projects have also seen adoption over the years.</p>

	<p>The key skill set I've used to accomplish this is my natural ability to quickly understand complex systems and simplify them in disruptive ways, a burning need to do good in the world, and an instinctive tenacity for always finding a way even in the most difficult of situations.</p>

	<p>Happy to cultivate friendships and business opportunities. <%-@link('resume', "View my resume.")%> <%-@link('contact', "Get in contact.")%></p>


<h3>I'm human too.</h3>

	<p>I'm absorbed in the art of <%-@link('simpleliving', 'simple')%> and <%-@link('nomad', 'nomadic')%></a> living, with a <%-@link('vegan', 'vegan')%> life-style and <%-@link('ahimsa', 'ahimsa')%> values. <%-@link('vegan', 'The data cannot recommend this lifestyle more highly.', 'Really, check it out.')%></p>

	<p>Through difficult and often traumatic times in my life, I've had the recurring personal afflictions of skin picking, <%-@link('trich', 'hair pulling')%>, and panic attacks. Since opening up about these aspects first to friends and then publicly in 2015 (at age 26), the overwhelming burden of shame I carried dissipated, which allowed me to move my attention from hating myself <!--(due to the bad parts)--> and hiding symptoms, to accepting myself <!--(including the bad parts)--> and fixing causes, with the surprising help of friends and other strugglers, down the road to an ever more resilient life. If you ever want to talk about it, <%-@link('contact', "feel free.")%></p>

	<p>You may cast me as a <%-@link('privileged')%> heterosexual white <%-@link('male')%> born into a <%-@link('ausvsusa', 'middle class society.')%> However (1) the practice of prejudice continues when people judge from these inherited properties instead of from character, (2) generalising is innate and correlations between identity and character exist, however the degree that someone's identity has influenced their character fluctuates from person to person (so while identity influences character, remember to access your judgements properly), and (3) due to the endeavours of my ancestors and society I've been afforded more free time (but no less agency) to spend continuing the tradition of increasing people's potential for self-actualisation (the head-start is thanks to my identity, the choices of how to spend my time is a matter of character).</p>

	<p>I'm a big believer in ephemeral living. I've recently discovered that <%-@link('fountainhead', "I'm my own person")%>. Coming up with great questions and answering them - staying true to myself by discovering myself - enabling joy and reducing oppression through education - are all passages deeply rooted in my soul.</p>


<h3>I've done many things.</h3>

	<p>In 1998 (age 8/9), I developed my first website for a <%-@link('perth')%> city council project as part of an accelerated learning <%-@link('peac')%> course, the project went on to win a state award. A few years later I started developing in <%-@link('csharp')%> to interact with the <%-@link('itunes')%> <%-@link('dll', 'DLLs')%> for the purpose of organising my music collection, I also started programming in <%-@link('ecmascript')%> in the form of <%-@link('flash')%> <%-@link('actionscript')%> for the purpose of creating a kickass full-fledged media player for my self, I also worked with <%-@link('html')%> and <%-@link('javascript')%> on the side for fun and pleasure. Around this time, I was diagnosed with <%-@link('trich')%> and until University, I would often be found with large bald spots throughout my scalp. I saw many psychologists through my childhood,
all of which were useless.</p>

	<!--<p>In 1999 (age 9/10), I encountered pornography for the first time in the form a spam email attachment. On the night of new year 1999/2000 I downloaded my first illegal MP3 of a song I already owned on CD, it was Goo Goo Dolls - Iris. I enjoyed a lot of story-based RPGs like Chrono Trigger, Robotrek, Final Fantasy, and The Sims. I read a lot of Goosebumps and Fear Street.</p>-->

	<p>In 2002 (age 12/13), I started <%-@link('tafe')%> night school earning my Certificates 1 to 4 in different programming concepts and languages, working with <%-@link('c')%>, <%-@link('csharp')%>, <%-@link('pascal')%>, <%-@link('cobol')%>, <%-@link('perl')%>, <%-@link('php')%>, <%-@link('asp')%> and other languages. During the day I was at <%-@link('comosec')%> in the accelerated learning <%-@link('ssst', 'SSST')%> program (a year ahead in Science, Maths, and Technology subjects) as well as in the <%-@link('hockeyacad')%> (doing 25 hours a week of <%-@link('hockey')%>, I was fit). It placed me in an interesting position of being a frat-boy and a nerd, the teachers worked with myself and another boy to use our influence to squash the bullying of our peers, it worked well. For fun, I <%-@link('bladelyf', 'rollerbladed')%>, played <%-@link('aoe')%> endlessly, did sleep overs, and hacked the school‚Äôs Windows network for fun with friends, earning us the position of ‚Äúintern advisors‚Äù for the school‚Äôs security and network systems.</p>

	<p>In 2005 (age 15/16), thanks to my night school studies of the previous years, I was able to drop out of <%-@link('highschool')%>, went to <%-@link('tafe')%> and earned my <%-@link('diplomaweb')%>, which allowed me to start University only a year later. At this time, I worked casually in a factory stacking fences from a conveyer belt and developed my first long term relationship<!--  and lived with a girl 5 years my senior (legal to <%-@link('consent')%>)-->, it was a wonderful maturing time, and brought a long-term end to my <%-@link('trich')%>. Around this time I also started experimenting with <%-@link('cannabis', 'cannabis')%> and alcohol socially. Interestingly, in this year I also got into a bit of trouble for hacking Microsoft‚Äôs <%-@link('livemessenger')%> premium content services (winks and dynamic profile pictures) as I had no money or debit card to buy them‚Ä¶ I used my <%-@link('flash')%> and <%-@link('javascript')%> skills to bypass the Flash checkout process of the Blue Mountain premium content service, then scraping their predictable premium content path structures, then developing a <%-@link('csharp')%> installer for the content by reverse engineering portions of the Messenger <%-@link('dll')%> install process. At the same time I gained prestige at <%-@link('tafe')%> by discovering an exploit in their <%-@link('webct')%> system and working with staff to rectify the situation, which I later published as <%-@link('webctexploit', 'my first white-hat security advisory')%> a few years after. Later, I also discovered that the same exploit worked on my university's system, however with the university‚Äôs strict ‚Äúhacking and your expelled‚Äù policy in place, I was too afraid of being expelled for sharing the exploit with them, so I never mentioned it‚Ä¶ leaving their systems insecure and open to actually malicious people, good work policy! üôÉ</p>

	<p>In 2006 (age 16/17), I commenced my <%-@link('degree')%> at <%-@link('curtin')%>, while freelancing with <%-@link('php')%> and <%-@link('javascript')%> development on the side. Around this time was also my foray into <%-@link('opensource')%> development with my plugins, freelancing, blogging, and core contributions to the <%-@link('b2evo')%> blogging system (a powerful alternative to <%-@link('wordpress')%>). I also visited <%-@link('switzerland')%> for a month to visit my partner, started an <%-@link('openrel', 'open-relationship')%> upon my return to <%-@link('Perth')%>, which resulted in a first heart break 6 months later, and also partied very hard throughout the year.</p>

	<p>In 2007 (age 17/18), I moved out of home with 2 other university friends into a house right next to the university, it was an amazing time, and an amazing <%-@link('bachelorpad')%> of alchohol, <%-@link('pool', 'pool billiards')%> tables, bars, and mattresses and friends everywhere all the time, it was a non-stop study and work infused party, and we loved it. It was also the time I published the <%-@link('lightbox')%>, which went on to become one of the most popular jQuery plugins of the time. Throughout these university/freelancing years I was stepped into the worlds of <%-@link('pua')%>, <%-@link('personaldev')%>, <%-@link('nlp')%>, <%-@link('hypno')%>, <%-@link('openrel')%>, <%-@link('sexpos')%>, <%-@link('halo3')%>, <%-@link('roadtrips')%>, <%-@link('opensource')%>, <%-@link('simpleliving')%>, and other <%-@link('extremelife')%>‚Ä¶ it was all packed full of confidence and experimenting, and it was wicked fun.</p>

	<p>In 2008 (age 18/19), after an intense week of exams, daily alcohol, daily marijuana, first-time <%-@link('lsd')%>, and first-time <%-@link('mdma')%>, I ended up in a moment of pure terror believing my lung had collapsed, ended up unconscious, woke up in hospital via ambulance, and diagnosed with a <%-@link('panic', 'panic attack')%>‚Ä¶ my <%-@link('bucket')%> had finally overflowed and it was terrifying‚Ä¶ I left that night with <%-@link('depersonalisation')%>, and over 6 months began hallucinating, hearing voices, and having <%-@link('night', 'night terrors')%>, afraid to sleep. Having one terrifying night terror that left me questioning my safety, I had my family take me to the <%-@link('gp')%> to get help and eventually see a <%-@link('psych')%> who helped me through it, with a further diagnosis of <%-@link('anxiety')%>. After 6 months of further recovery, I got through it to normality once again, and another 6 months later until I was able to have caffeine again.</p>

	<p>In 2009 (age 19/20), I started feeling a lot of guilt for my fantastic life while others were in poverty. In January 2010, I went to <%-@link('bali')%> for the first time with my father and an <%-@link('exhange')%>, we had a fantastic time, but I was also harrowed by the poverty I encountered‚Ä¶ It would go on to increase my investment to do good by the world.</p>

	<p>In 2010 (age 20/21), my foray into kinder food choices began. I had watched <%-@link('ocean', 'this talk')%> and immediately stopped consuming fish. A while later, for some reason or the other, I stopped using dairy for milk. I also developed a new relationship, and my first <%-@link('closedrel', 'closed-relationship')%>, to a wonderful woman <!-- 8 years my senior --> who helped me mature in life and work very much so.</p>

	<p>In 2011 (age 21/22), I was invited to speak in <%-@link('austria')%> by <%-@link('gentics')%> for their <%-@link('aloha')%> <%-@link('alohadevcon', 'Dev Con')%> of which I was a lead developer, it was a fantastic insight to get to meet other great <%-@link('javascript')%> developers at the time, especially for a small-town syndrome Australian! Upon returning, I moved to <%-@link('sydney')%> from <%-@link('perth')%> for better work opportunities and to be with my partner, who was fighting for custody of her children. I worked with miscellaneous startups earning street cred and an increasing hourly rate, due to my years of <%-@link('opensource')%> experience and commitment to quality. I went from the $10/hour newcomer to the goto JavaScript expert within the year. Eventually, I obtained a full-time $60/hour contract with Sydney company <%-@link('acidgreen')%> developing long-term JavaScript solutions for their medical and government clients.<!-- I also got married to my wonderful partner in a small ceremony overlooking the <%-@link('bridge')%>. --></p>

	<p>In 2012 (age 22/23), I left the amazing <%-@link('acidgreen')%> who where running out of work for me, to consult for the Melbourne startup <%-@link('bugherd')%>, earning my highest hourly rate so far. I developed their first <%-@link('spa')%> solution along with other innovations like <%-@link('queryengine', 'Live Collections')%> and a <%-@link('crossbrowser')%> <%-@link('screenshot')%> <%-@link('extension', 'Extension')%>. Once that ended, I burnt through my savings going all in with attempting to transform <%-@link('bevry', 'Bevry\'s')%> <%-@link('lossleader', 'loss-leader')%> <%-@link('docpad')%> into a profitable income stream. At one point I ran out of money, and a person called <%-@link('kasper')%> out of nowhere, a <%-@link('historyjs')%> user, bailed me out with some cash and sound advice for finding new clients, which I did, thanks to him.</p>

	<p>In 2013 (age 23/24), I was invited to <%-@link('metarefresh')%> in <%-@link('bangalore')%> to speak to 400 people about <%-@link('whysucks', 'finding your way despite competition')%>. I then flew to <%-@link('bali')%> with my partner to setup the first full-time <%-@link('hostel')%>. I didn't enjoy the setting up procedure much, however fortunately enough other people did. There are now more than <%-@link('hostellist', '30 hostels')%> for startup folk around the world. In June I also received salvation for my gamble in <%-@link('docpad')%> with a full-time income to work on it from <%-@link('toronto')%> company <%-@link('myplanet')%> (and got to visit them twice!). I also visited <%-@link('berlin')%> to train students in <%-@link('javascript')%>. This year also marked my introduction to <%-@link('mindful')%> via <%-@link('tolle', "Eckhart Tolle's")%> works, and started reading <%-@link('paulo')%>.</p>

	<p>In 2014 (age 24/25), the funding ended and I burned out from 10 years of professional programming and of life in general, after a while I embraced <%-@link('moneyless')%> and became a volunteer at a <%-@link('paycan', 'donation-based')%> <%-@link('lentil', 'vegan soup kitchen in Sydney')%>. It was perhaps the most rewarding work I've ever done in my life. I actually got to smile, laugh, and interact with people, solving a real need - joyous food and great company - without discrimination (even financial). I also was unable to find enough paying work that allowed me to continue my <%-@link('opensource')%> endeavours and lived homeless in the streets of <%-@link('sydney')%> for a few months.</p>

	<p>In 2015 (age 25/26), I <%-@link('hitch', 'hitchhiked')%> 10,000KM throughout <%-@link('australia')%>, notably between <%-@link('perth')%>, <%-@link('uluru')%>, Brisbane, <%-@link('sydney')%>, Melbourne, <%-@link('nullabor')%>, and back to Perth. It was an adventure of a life-time. At some point, I desire to commence foot on the <%-@link('walk')%>, a 1,000KM walk from Perth to Albany in Western Australia ‚Äî I plan on doing this alone to discover what doors it opens and closes for me. I also wrote <%-@link('book', 'my first book')%>.</p>

	<p>In 2016 (age 26/27), I completed the last unit of my degree after a 6 year hiatus, becoming a <%-@link('degree')%> graduate enabling global employment. I also gave the talk <%-@link('elegant')%> at <%-@link('nodeconfeu16')%> and worked through some private matters. I also started (co-)hosting the <%-@link('jbpcommunity')%>, including a <%-@link('jbpyoutube', 'weekly podcast')%>.</p>

	<p>In 2017 (age 27/28), I resumed then paused my lucrative freelancing, and completed the switch to <%-@link('trading', 'automated/algorithmic stock and cryptocurrency trading')%>. Now I can grow and make money outside of the tech world's autocratic political delusions, and use the profits to create several businesses of varying scale. I also moved from Australia to Asia and will be motorbiking around for my own sanity.</p>

	<p>In 2018 (age 28/29), I anticipate developments in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence will intersect with trading markets, to the extent of economic terrorism. I intend to see how much profits my aptitudes will get me before it is too late.</p>

	<p>In 2019 (age 30/31), I wish to start focusing on having a family for the years ahead.</p>
