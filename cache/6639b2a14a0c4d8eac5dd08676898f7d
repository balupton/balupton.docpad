            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My submission to <a href="mailto:allbelong@airbnb.com">allbelong@airbnb.com</a> regarding their potentially dangerous <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/help/topic/533/nondiscrimination">Community Commitment</a> proposal. Feel free to send as your own, with or without modifications (though change my name of course!). License is public domain.</p><p>Subject: <em>Feedback about the Community Commitment</em></p><p>Hi there,</p><p>Airbnb’s Community Commitment proposal implies that hosts must submit to their guests beliefs to remain hosts on your platform, even if those beliefs are unfounded, a concerning notion which is easily illustrated with the following <em>perceived disabilities</em> and <em>gender identities</em> example:</p><blockquote>&gt; Gender identification as an attack helicopter, with pronouns pewpewpewpew (subjective), schulschulschulschul (objective) and Geronimo (possessive), and with a perceived disability of having no face.</blockquote><p>The current policy enforces that the host must submit to such delusions to conform with Airbnb, which outlaws what conscientious respect would be, which would be getting them help, not entertaining their delusions:</p><blockquote>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/F43kaxT3698">https://youtu.be/F43kaxT3698</a> — Airbnb style University of Michigan’s gender identity policy in action</blockquote><p>There is a big difference between respecting beliefs and respecting people. To illustrate, here is the definition of <strong><em>respect</em></strong>:</p><blockquote>&gt; <strong>respect</strong> |rɪˈspɛkt| noun 2 <strong>due regard </strong>for the feelings, wishes, or rights of others. E.g. young people’s lack of respect for their parents.</blockquote><p>Which necessitates at times, a disrespect for one’s beliefs, especially when beliefs can be undeserving and counteractive to one’s wellbeing.</p><p><strong><em>Due regard</em></strong> by definition<strong> </strong>is the linchpin of respect, yet this is often forgotten. Respect is earned, through scrutiny and excellence. It seems many from the political correctness ideology believe breathing entitles others to obey them. Not the case, as per the definition chain of <strong><em>due</em></strong>:</p><blockquote>&gt; <strong>due</strong> |djuː| adjective 2 <em>[attributive] </em>of the proper quality or extent</blockquote><blockquote>&gt; <strong>due</strong> |djuː| noun 1 (one’s due/dues) one’s right; what is owed to one:<em> he thought it was his due</em>.</blockquote><blockquote>&gt; <strong>owe</strong> |əʊ| verb<em> [with object] </em>have an obligation to pay or repay (something, especially money) in return for something received</blockquote><blockquote>&gt; <strong>owe</strong> one a living: used to express disapproval of someone who expects to receive financial support or other benefits without doing any work:<em> they think the world owes them a living</em>.</blockquote><p>I understand however under marxist/socialist/communist/leftist ideologies that one does believe breathing entitles one to all the same benefits as everyone else, and that if one doesn’t submit willingly to their cause, consensual arrangements and freedom from oppression are thrown out the window and the oppression of gun comes in. Avoiding oppression should be everyone’s aim, not increasing it.</p><p>&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAM70Sg_irU">https://youtu.be/XAM70Sg_irU</a>—the left value oppression more than consensual arrangements</p><p>It is rarely the case that respect for one’s ideas ever results in respect for one as a person. Fake sincerity plays into this — asking how one is, but not actually caring, is not caring, no matter how much sociopaths wish it to be.</p><p>Beliefs are dangerous if respected, it is how language becomes censored and how bad ideas go unchallenged. With censored language, one cannot fight in the battle ground of ideas, instead there will be only the battle ground of silencing and hostility, the tools of authoritarians, in which truth is not valued over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness">agreeableness</a>:</p><blockquote>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/-4R0bWC41g4">https://youtu.be/-4R0bWC41g4</a><br>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/mDg8sP_atIA">https://youtu.be/mDg8sP_atIA</a> — how tolerance can create problems<br>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/Bpim_n0r0z0">https://youtu.be/Bpim_n0r0z0</a> — risks on campus and introduction to political and personality profiles<br>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/fvPgjg201w0">https://youtu.be/fvPgjg201w0</a>—campus political correctness, and personality profiles<br>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/7oCmhZ-1gGc">https://youtu.be/7oCmhZ-1gGc</a> — should freedom of speech include the license to offend<br>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/zQqxlzHJrU0">https://youtu.be/zQqxlzHJrU0</a> — dangers in how political correctness impair truth<br>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/WRGyvFykakI">https://youtu.be/WRGyvFykakI</a> — great talk on skepticism and why it feels scary<br>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/hkhUivqzWv0">https://youtu.be/hkhUivqzWv0</a> — a direct criticism of euphemisms<br>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/AnDZ4ERVSGo">https://youtu.be/AnDZ4ERVSGo</a> — if you enjoy all the above, good quick followup</blockquote><p>This policy is very concerning for hosts, for which I am not currently, but will now will never intend to be. I feel for current hosts that value <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concientiousness">conscientiousness</a> over agreeableness, of which consensual agreements that respect people are being overturned by AirBnB’s authority — the opposite of liberty — in fact, the antithesis of <strong><em>liberty</em></strong>:</p><blockquote>&gt; <strong>liberty</strong> |ˈlɪbəti| noun (plural liberties) [mass noun] 1 the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one’s behaviour or political views. E.g. compulsory retirement would interfere with individual liberty.</blockquote><p>I hope that AirBnB goes back to respecting people, respecting consensual agreements, punishing non-consensual arrangements, rather than only allowing consent when it aligns with dangerous political agendas, which disrespects people, enforces submission to delusions, belittles the agency of adults as if they are children, and silences opposition to promote groupthink:</p><blockquote>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/XAM70Sg_irU">https://youtu.be/XAM70Sg_irU</a> — enforcement always comes at the cost of liberties, and that balance must be made to increase liberty and agency, never create dependence<br>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/HwF9SFaKy6U">https://youtu.be/HwF9SFaKy6U</a> — it is unfair on these kids to never be provided counter view points, in fact, it is indoctrinating them into blinder spots<br>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/ffOPImz4Rp0">https://youtu.be/ffOPImz4Rp0</a> — it is sad such kids then protected from cognitive dissonance, do not understand cognitive dissonance provides opportunity for growth if embraced, rather than regression is resisted<br>&gt; <a href="https://twitter.com/balupton/status/792299505387311104">https://twitter.com/balupton/status/792299505387311104</a> — some other concerning examples of how this policy would be detrimental to respecting people</blockquote><p>Finally, as an aside, a note on gender to partner with the earlier resources:</p><blockquote>&gt; <a href="https://youtu.be/fW6AndSUByo">https://youtu.be/fW6AndSUByo</a> and <a href="http://www.helenfisher.com/downloads/articles/Brown_et_al_2013.pdf">http://www.helenfisher.com/downloads/articles/Brown_et_al_2013.pdf</a> — personality seems more about a matrix of hormones, some of which are more prominent in different sexes, which would invalidate notion of gender spectrum</blockquote><p>Sincerely,<br>Benjamin Lupton<br><a href="https://balupton.com">https://balupton.com</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f6341824bba9" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/ephemeral-living/difference-between-respect-and-submission-f6341824bba9">Difference between respect and submission</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ephemeral-living">Benjamin Lupton’s Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2017 I anticipate we will see a new generation of <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net">static site generator</a> (SSG) emerge, with importing and rendering decoupled from one another.</p><p>So far the generations of static site generators have been:</p><ol><li>1990s — static sites were generated by humans, written by hand, editing HTML directly in tools like frontpage, dreamweaver and notepad</li><li>2000s — static sites were generated through desktop applications, where the end-user edited their website via a desktop app, and unbeknown to the user the application would update an internal database, maintain the files, and upload them to the server</li><li>2010s — static site were generated through file system compilers, these focused on developer power, with features like file system as the database, and markdown support, early prominent examples include <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> for Ruby and <a href="https://docpad.org">DocPad</a> for Node.js</li></ol><p>I see a new generation emerging, containing the following interdependent ecosystem parts:</p><ul><li>External Database: content is stored in a modern database system that supports realtime publish/subscribe, such as <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org">couchdb</a> and <a href="https://rethinkdb.com">rethinkdb</a></li><li>Importing: content is imported into the database from any location, such as a computer’s file system, a medium blog, a Wordpress blog</li><li>Rendering: content is exported from the database to any location, such as a static site generator to generate a static website, or to a comment javascript widget</li><li>API Extensions: content is updated in the database using rich API extensions that wrap/extend the database, such as a <a href="https://balupton.com/zapier">Zapier</a> or <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> extensions that tweet new posts automatically, or SDKs for different languages, or an API extension that allows native comment interfaces to read and add comments to blog posts, or even an extension to provide a Wordpress compatible API hook their desktop interface <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">Calypso</a> up to the database.</li><li>Native Interfaces: content is exposed from the database with interfaces optimised for particular tasks, want a Wordpress/Calypso style interface, want a Medium style interface, want a Tumblr style interface, or a custom interface for your particular client? These interfaces can be built ontop of the API extensions as an alternative to importing content from existing systems.</li></ul><p>So what’s the problems with today’s static site generators?</p><ul><li>Todays SSGs use an in-memory database or their own external database system, both of which are designed only for their static site generator, and are not extensible as an open eco-system</li><li>Todays SSGs load, render, and forget on each run, with large static sites taking minutes to generate accurately (change the title of a page that is references in the menu that is used on every page should update every page), realtime changes are not possible with this current system</li><li>Todays SSGs require complex workarounds for anyone but developers to edit then publish the content; web design firm clients may be forced to edit content locally then send to the developer to update, or the developer sets up a workflow on the clients machine, or tells the client to use some special webservice like <a href="http://prose.io">Prose.io</a>, all of which are inferior compared to what that Wordpress admin interface they are use to — plus when they click save, they must wait minutes to see the final result of each change locally, and even longer to see each change eventually propagate to the live website, all unacceptable to the majority of clients — plus in some systems, clients could break things as they may now edit content or template files that they are not familiar with</li></ul><p>The proposed 2017 generation of SSGs will solve this by:</p><ul><li>Importers will be able to allow clients to use the multitude of services they already use, such as Medium, Wordpress, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and for developers the file system, and import that plethora of content into the modern database speedily</li><li>The modern database will readily provide access to the latest direct content and imported content, across the interwebs rather than just a local machine, so that a team can work on the same content, including updating and exporting it</li><li>Exporters will allow for realtime changes to be rendered to all needed destinations, with only the needed changes being rendered and propagated and deployed, rather than the entire static website — reducing minutes to seconds</li><li>API Extensions will allow interactivity with these static sites through pragmatic developer tools or even ideal Native Interfaces for particular clients, allowing dynamic extensible experiences, at little cost</li></ul><p>Why hasn’t this occurred yet?</p><ul><li>Today’s SSGs chose in-memory databases due to the complex setup of powerful database systems at the same, however in 2017 powerful database systems are a lot easier to setup, often with one click installers and even as bundled dependencies as part of a applications or SSGs</li><li>Today’s SSGs were intended for the hobbyist programmer, with the value to clients being an afterthought, as such the workflow for clients is incredibly complex, and things like editing and previewing production changes is just too complicated to be worthwhile — now with hindsight we can rearchitect the SSG to meet all needs, with different importers covering file system use cases for developers and external content services for clients</li><li>Today’s SSGs are competitive rather than collaborative because at the time, no one else was doing it, so they could be independent — however now there are over <a href="https://staticsitegenerators.net">400 static site generators</a> — and this competition is causing duplicate effort — how many markdown rendering plugins do we really need? — instead importers can be written to import in popular SSG source content to migrate from them, and exporters can be written to export to popular SSG source content to render with them, as interim solutions</li></ul><p>Is anyone already doing this?</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.contentful.com">Contentful</a> is the main player with their coupled system of Database + API + Interface, and ecosystem of extensions for importers and exporters. However, <a href="https://github.com/contentful-labs/awesome-contentful">their current ecosystem</a> is a fraction of what is ultimately possible—I’d like to see SSGs tout Contentful support on their homepages, as well as hundreds of integrations and contributors, not tens. Their solution also requires dependency on connection to the Contentful service, which requires online availability, which means no offline/local development/testing/previews. It also requires fitting within their payment plans, which in turn allow for premium support. Finally, as their solution is a coupled solution, performance and customisation are sacrificed for convenience. None of which are necessarily bad things due to the tradeoffs each thing provides, however still they are limitations worth noting.</li></ul><p>What proposals exist for what can be done?</p><ul><li>Existing static site generators can continue to try to meet evergreen needs like realtime content imports and client updates with their existing architectures but <a href="https://discuss.bevry.me/t/deprecating-in-memory-docpad-importers-exporters/87?u=balupton">ultimately fail</a> as their architectures can only hack such features into them, rather than support them by design</li><li>Contentful can allow local installs of their platform to solve the local development, testing, previews issue, as well as improve their ecosystem and API to offer more power to the developers as a workaround for their proprietary nature.</li><li>The community can organise to develop these ideas further, into an open and collaborative effort between forward-thinking static site generators. A database system will need to be picked, I believe rethinkdb is the best for this, but it should be discussed. Once picked, work can then commence on Importers, Exporters, API Extensions, and Native Interfaces around the chosen database system. SSGs can then update themselves to be exporters for this new system — giving them the benefits of this new united system. An agnostic database system is also an option but its complexity over agility makes it better for a later feature of the system rather than an initial consideration.</li></ul><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=164c3b7b9f97" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/ephemeral-living/2017s-generation-of-static-site-generators-164c3b7b9f97">2017’s Generation of Static Site Generators</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ephemeral-living">Benjamin Lupton’s Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What distribution of race and sex should we optimise for? — a global distribution or a distribution local to the conference’s location, or another? Is a conference in Japan expected to have Nigerian distributions of race? Is a conference in Nigeria expected to have a Japanese distribution of race?</p><p>When you say “white supremacy” and “non-white” what do you mean exactly, how do you determine that, and why? If you mean caucasians, do you mean a certain local population of caucasians, or a global population, which and why? If you mean any individual or race that looks white, how is the criteria defined exactly and why? If you mean Nazis, how would you determine non-aryans? If you mean historic American slave owners, how would you factor in white slaves, non-white masters and non-americans? If you mean historic American segregation, how would you factor in non-white supporters and non-americans? If you mean the alt-right, how would you factor in whites in America and around the world that are not part of that group?</p><p>How would mixed races be handled? How do the citizens of Australia, New Zealand, and Japan factor into this? — they are majority white, yet have histories and cultures that American and European politics do not apply to or even should apply to, and I would wager, are also underrepresented in American conferences. How would the Jewish race and culture be handled as they are also white?</p><p>Are we talking about cismen, or transmen, or both? — discriminating against transmen, who identify as men, seems incoherent with the helping of the marginalised goal.</p><p>Should the distributions of sex and gender be proportionate to the particular profession? If garbage collectors gave a conference, should they aim for 50% women presenting? How would you factor in general group and individual personality traits, interests, availability, and incentives?</p><p>If you are optimising for those held back by the patriarchy and white supremacy, why just those, why not also optimise for those marginalised on issues like citizenship, culture, location, religion, personality, mental health, wealth, politics, and any other factor that marginalises, and if so, how would you do it? What happens when one factor oppresses another, how would that math work?</p><p>How would you define the patriarchy? Is it a global force that applies cleanly to all countries? How would you factor in women who support the patriarchy or benefit from it? How would you factor in women who reject the patriarchy? How would you factor in data that contradicts the patriarchy? How would you factor in groups and individuals that may be marginalised yet oppress another group like women? How would you factor in instances where the patriarchy is used as a reason to discriminate, harass, and assault the groups that it considers privileged?</p><p>How would you factor in deserving individuals that are held back by racist and sexist discrimination practices that discriminate individuals based on their group identities? How would you factor in individuals whose identities are marginalised, but yet their own individual high status makes them an exception? How would you factor in individuals whose identities are not marginalised, but yet their own individual low status makes them an exception?</p><p>Or, should we optimise for getting individuals to submit talks, instead of identities?</p><p>These questions are in response to these tweet threads by <a href="https://medium.com/u/2aba2e2f2208">isaacs</a><br><a href="https://twitter.com/izs/status/911105515798720513">https://twitter.com/izs/status/911105515798720513</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/izs/status/911730557666471937">https://twitter.com/izs/status/911730557666471937</a></p><p>Isaac has responded to this post, but not the questions, in <a href="https://twitter.com/balupton/status/914893915672608768">this twitter thread</a>.</p><p>If anyone can answer these questions, please do.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8900612c68d4" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/ephemeral-living/questions-for-isaac-schlueter-8900612c68d4">Questions for Isaac Schlueter</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ephemeral-living">Benjamin Lupton’s Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What vegans and non-vegans alike don’t get about veganism, and why dialogue between two sides often results in unnecessary confrontation</h3><p>Vegan is a loaded term, conversations about it often expose preconceptions and judgments that hinder dialogue, incite conflict, and contort meanings. It does not have to be this way for many reasons, several of which you may not have expected.</p><p>The first and foremost reason is the most uninteresting one; it is the one about what veganism is. The second and other reason builds on the first and is the more interesting and fundamental one; it is the one about accepting that violations always exist, even if they are necessary or unnecessary, or avoidable or unavoidable. Let us begin.</p><h4>What is veganism</h4><p>Veganism is specifically a doctrine of a single tenet, containing a single principle. Things that uphold this doctrine are considered vegan.</p><blockquote>“The word veganism shall mean the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals.”<em> </em><a href="http://www.ivu.org/history/world-forum/1951vegan.html">Veganism Defined (Leslie Cross, The Vegan Society, 1951)</a></blockquote><p>So a vegan diet is a diet that upholds this doctrine. A vegan is a person who does. Vegans are a group of people who do. A vegan restaurant is a restaurant which does.</p><p>Alignment with this doctrine is solely what makes something vegan, not anything else. As such, veganism is a political ideology. One may consume a vegan diet for health reasons, but unless they believe that principle, then they are not a vegan, they are just merely a consumer of a vegan diet.</p><p>A definition to note is that “animal” is often used colloquially to refer to “animals other than the <em>human animal</em>” or derogatively as “an animal beneath the <em>human animal</em>”. However, there is also the definition that includes humans as animals, which is why we can even say the <em>human animal.</em></p><blockquote>“Animal: A living organism which feeds on organic matter, typically having specialised sense organs and nervous system and able to respond rapidly to stimuli.”<em> </em><a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/animal">Oxford Dictionary</a><em> </em>/<em> </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal">Wikipedia</a></blockquote><p>Veganism in essence is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism">abolitionism</a> for all animals, not just the human animals.</p><p>As veganism’s doctrine only covers a single principle, the implementation of that principle is up to the discretion of the individual vegan and their circumstances. To quote the Vegan Society, in the same article as before:</p><blockquote>“If, for example, the vegan principle is applied to diet, it can at once be seen why it must be vegetarian in the strictest sense and why it cannot contain any foods derived from animals. One may become a vegetarian for a variety of reasons — humanitarian, health, or mere preference for such a diet; The principle is a matter of personal feeling, and varies accordingly. Veganism, however, is a principle — that man has no right to exploit the creatures for his own ends — and no variation occurs. Vegan diet is therefore derived entirely from “fruits, nuts, vegetables, grains and other wholesome non-animal products,” and excludes “flesh, fish, fowl, eggs, honey and animal milk and its derivatives.”<em> </em><a href="http://www.ivu.org/history/world-forum/1951vegan.html">Veganism Defined (Leslie Cross, The Vegan Society, 1951)</a></blockquote><p>There are items that are outside a strict-vegetarian (plant-based) set that comply with veganism, such as lab-grown meat, which is not vegetarian but is vegan. Others can be second-hand leather, fur, and down. This is because those instances of procurement do not result in the oppression of an animal.</p><p>As veganism is only a principle, one becomes a vegan by merely agreeing with the principle, despite differing application. There exists times where it is necessary to harm an animal, in order to prevent harm to yourself — which affects application, but not belief. However, by having that belief, one is likely to attempt avoiding making that same violation again in the future. Such as packing more vegan food next trip so one doesn’t need to procure non-vegan food, or cleaning up your kitchen properly so one doesn’t need to kill more pests.</p><p>As such, when it comes to the individual application, veganism increases inquisition into the consequences of our encounters with animals, be it direct encounters (eg. did this product oppress animals in its procurement? or for pests, should I relocate it or kill it?) or are indirect (eg. should I financially support companies that test on animals? should I financially support non-vegan practices with patronage at non-vegan restaurants?). This equips the diligent vegan with a wealth of research and contemplation for their own congruence with veganism. This undoubtably is a barrier to entry for many, and somtimes judged as laudable and disdainful by non-vegans. How one judges it seems to depend on how important one places the vegan principle, that the more important it is to someone, as like the abolition of human slavery, then the more one willingly sacrifices conveniences as a worthwhile rewarding exchange for them, even to be a practice of spirtuality, the upkeeping of their spirit rather than the undermining of it.</p><p>Like any movement, veganism unfortunately is incorrectly associated with the common and not-so-common individual practices of its followers, rather than by the actual doctrine of it.</p><h4>Violations are inevitable, how you deal with them is your choice</h4><p>For the argument that it is okay for humans to oppress non-human animals, to be diligent we must ask why and when? The research going into the ideologies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocentrism">anthropocentrism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism">speciesism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnism">carnism</a>, work to tackle the cultural issues of that position. For when that position is or is not justified, the considerations of necessary harm come into play<em>.</em></p><p>Before we consider necessary harm. Let us first evaluate the argument “a cow that lived happily that is then killed for human consumption is sufficiently ethical”. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_welfare">animal welfare</a> argument over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights">animal rights</a> argument.</p><p>While I and others do not like the term <em>rights</em> for non-human animals, as it does not seem technically correct, as non-human animals cannot uphold law and thus cannot uphold rights. It is what that line of arguments are called that focus on reducing our enslavement of animals, rather than just improving their wellbeing.</p><p>There is no disagreement that while animals are actively enslaved, that striving to improve their conditions is fantastic for the animal, improves the conscience of the farmer, and the quality of the produce. The stance that the vegan doctrine takes however is that we should strive to not violate the animal in the first place. The most common violations are the killing for meat, the sexual abuse for breast milk, and the concentration camps for eggs and honey.</p><p>Those who promote animal welfare and ignore animal rights, argue on necessity pleas, of which there are many. The most common pleas generally are arguments for survival, unique health conditions, economic and ecological dependencies, etc.</p><p><strong>However, what all these necessity pleas fail to realise is that necessity doesn’t make a violation no longer a violation. Even despite the violation now having some justifications to its necessity, the violation still exists and should still be avoided.</strong></p><p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_agency">moral agents</a> we encounter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>, an unconcious angst that presents itself when there is a mismatch between what we are doing, what we ought to do, and what we want to do. The goal of cognitive dissonance is to eradicate violations to make us more integrated and functional.</p><p>When we recognise animals as people that have their own lives, a will to live, a will to be free, a will to self-actualise, then we recognise that we are violating this person, violating their will to live, violating their will to be free, violating their will to self-actualise. We then have a choice of, do we wish to maximise the violations of these animals, violations that take the forms of sexual abuse, enslavement, and killing — or do we wish to minimise it? This becomes a mismatch of our wanting self, should self, and actual self.</p><p>These violations also come at an expense to ourself, as violations of our own value of kindness and compassion, and to our own belief in civil liberty and reciprocity.</p><p>Veganism resolves these particular instances of cognitive dissonance through consumer choice and education, refined corporate practices, and government regulations.</p><p>However, necessary violations are still violations, and a violation is still something that should be aimed to be avoided. Killing against a victim’s will is bad, it is a violation of someone else’s agency. Killing in self defence can be justified, however despite the justification, a violation has still occured, and it should still be a situation to avoid occuring in the first place.</p><p>In the Steppes of Mongolia, the ecology is comprised of humans, horses, wolves, and grass. The humans protect the horses from the wolves, and that forms an aliance between the horses and the humans, allowing horse riding to be possible. The humans will eat the weakest horse when it comes time to not starve. From the carcass they feed and build their home and tools for their family. The horse is killed against its will, to prevent further harm to the humans (by fending off starvation), and even perhaps to prevent further harm to the horses (humans become nourished enough to continue protecting the horses from the wolves). The killing of the horse is still a violation, despite it being necessary in those circumstances, and the necessity of it does not mean a violation did not occur, nor does it negate the violation.</p><p>The idea that necessity eliminates violations, seems to stem from a naive belief that one is, or even can be, violation free. But one who has killed, even when justified, is still a killer. No amount of neccessity surrounding a violation removes the fact that the violation still occurred. All that the necessity states is that the violation was justified, not that it did not occur. Being violation free in the face of a violation is wishful and delusional thinking, a longing for a sense of purity that is nonexistent.</p><p>It is not possible to be put into an ecology and never violate any other being’s rights/freedoms inside that ecology. Every order we place, we participate in an ecosystem of tradeoffs, a few little violations are exchanged for a little wealth. However of course, this creates unease, as we desire to be ethical, virtuous, honest, integrated people, as such committing violations concerns us, often deeply and endlessly. We simply do not want to commit violations and if for whatever reason we do, we go through cognitive dissonance, often excruciatingly so, which takes many forms. This continues until we find a belief system that can integrate the violations congruently with our shoulds, wants, and actuals. For instance, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism">Jainism</a>, a Jain wishes to never have a violation of harm on their conscience, so they practice veganism and even avoid eating root vegetables, as that is an act that kills the entire plant. For most of us, Jainism is not worth the trade offs, perhaps we can save more animal and plant lives by eating potatoes with our particular circumstances. We do not have to throw out the baby with the bathwater. This is why you still likely use a mobile phone or computer, despite the sweatshops and mining conditions involved, it is a worthwhile trade; a few little violations for each procurement of the device, exchanged for the potential good that your actions with the device can bring to the world.</p><p>Since the dawn of mankind, we’ve created endless beliefs and rationalisations to provide comfort for the ceaseless angst that unavoidable violations play on our conscience, often with religious practices. Or we downright ignore it, never resolving our dissonance, becoming quick to trigger. As technology and society progresses, less moral violations remain necessary, updating our belief systems accordingly. Now, for the first time in history, a nutritionally complete/comparable selection of plant products are available to the average supermarket consumer, regardless of the consumer’s season and budget — making veganism now enter the public consciousness, as oppressing animals wanes into the unncessary. As an example, imagine getting a shepherd 2000 years ago to become nutrient complete and thriving on plants alone for their entire life, it could not happen, so instead rules and ideologies around the necessary consumption of animals were created to workaround the guilt of the oppression of the animal which no longer apply today. Saying the prayer before slaughter/eating “thank you God for forgiving my sin in taking this animal’s life so that I can live and not die from starvation” hardly applies when the animal was killed mass-market by someone else so you can enjoy their flesh in an airplane at 35,000 ft flying in the sky — there is no unavoidable necessity of starvation in that circumstance — yet the legacy of those rational delusions sputter onward.</p><p>For any atrocity throughout history, one will always find a companion rationalisation or ideology that provides justifications for the atrocity’s existence. Do those justifications ever make that atrocity okay? No. Should atrocities always be sought to be avoided? Yes.</p><p>Vegans and non-vegans alike, all actively educate themselves on avoiding the violations that are important to them, to attempt to prevent systematic atrocities that could come from those violations. Vegans are merely those aligned with tackling a particular set of violations, that is the violations and atrocities against non-human animals. Violations that manifest themselves in the accessible mundane consumer choices that we all make multiple times each day. Does that mean non-vegans are evil? No. Does that mean vegans are pure? No. Does that mean the violations each individual is aware of should be examined by the other? Yes, they both may be aware of different violations that either can act upon, or even different necessities that may justify (but not overlook) such violations.</p><p>Different focuses of violation between people seem to arise fundamentally from the oversight and refusal to accept that with a particular set of violations, one is not violation free, and that one may never be. Sometimes violations are necessary, sometimes unnecessary, yet should always be aimed to be avoided. Until this is accepted by those in dialogue, then dialogue remains trapped in stress fused justification battles from the perceived vilification of others and ourselves, which just isn’t productive for progress by any means. Once we accept our violations (which can be eased by recognising that we did not know at the time, and thus the violations were likely unavoidable then) dialogue productively moves to identifying and understanding differences of necessity and avoidability. Moving the focus to which violations are still required, which can be avoided today, and which can be phased out through effort and time.</p><p>This isn’t to say we should drop everything we do and become a vegan or a jain, it is to say we should educate ourselves on all exposed violations and identify which are ultimately avoidable and passionate in our own lives. One can hate the messenger or their delivery, but to ignore their valid points just because one hates the messenger, is a behaviour that is unvirtuous by any standard.</p><p>We need to stop suppressing the guilt of our violations. We must recognise naive, ignorant or outdated thought patterns or ideologies that are hiding our violations away from us. We must bring violations to light and examine them and scrutinise them, together and individually, to decide are they indeed violations? were they necessary? and how can they be avoided in the times to come?</p><p>Otherwise, what nobility is there in oppressing animals when the violation was unnecessary and/or avoidable? None that I can see.</p><h4>Fin.</h4><p>Let me know your thoughts and arguments, or whatever that resonated, agreed, or disagreed with you. I’m keen to know.</p><p>I wrote this on <a href="https://medium.com/ephemeral-living/what-vegans-and-non-vegans-alike-dont-get-about-veganism-c60913a8ca5b">21 November 2015</a>, hopefully it is still relevant.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One notion that I would love to see for Civic Technology, is the following:</p><p>1. The current voting system is predicated on the cost of voting — an election being held every 4 years, or certain rare policies going to the ballot all seem tied to the extreme expense of voting (in all areas that voting inconveniences the population)</p><p>2. Digital voting, like most things digital, can reduce the cost of voting to near naught. Meaning that voting can occur far more often with more ease. Meaning the population can now vote for more policies, with quicker feedback, quicker results, and faster adaptation.</p><p>3. This could create a government that is a collection of volunteers, whose job is to enact the list of evergreen policies that reflect the current societies votes on each issue.</p><p>4. Campaigning instead becomes about policies, which the public votes for or against, and can change their vote whenever they want.</p><p>5. To ensure that policies have the chance to be useful before campaigns destroy them, each policy has a term. So if a policy moves from majority support to minority support, or the other way round, the policy still continues for its term, and if still in minority support at the end of the term, it is not renewed. This immediate feedback during the term allows the volunteers implementing the policy to react to public opinion and do any fixes that are necessary.</p><p>6. As not everyone will have the time to research every issue. Thanks to digital voting, people could delegate their votes for particular things to another person, and then vote on only the things they care about. Delegates could also do this. This would accomplish the role of parties and representatives but to a better degree.</p><p>This doesn’t have to be implemented all together, instead with each succession of digital voting, the convenience and benefits will win out economically against the traditional way. For instance, if we implement digital voting for the next election, the economic arguments will stand, and then next election the implementation will be greater, and then politicians realise as the societal costs are less they start using it more for policy opinions, etc etc. So I believe this is the end goal we are all aiming for, just articulated.</p><p>It also raises super interesting questions in terms of how society will divide itself if we can now be as naunced as we like with our political factions and divides, as those categorisations would in voting applications fall away, but probably still persist in social applications. How would competiting policies play a role? Could competiting policies both be impemented at the same time — would that be a policy in of itself? How would mandated voting like Australia has, play a role?</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>The progression approach is a rather recent addition to this notion, which I can thank a recent discussion with <a href="http://dominictarr.com">Dominic Tarr</a> for.</p><p>The delegation approach is another recent addition, which I can thank <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/115820783646323087787">Adem Ingham</a> for.</p><p>For a political party working to accomplish this aim, see <a href="https://voteflux.org">Vote Flux</a>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=71a18f3b9977" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/ephemeral-living/government-as-volunteers-implementing-digital-voted-for-policies-some-thoughts-71a18f3b9977">Government as volunteers implementing digitally voted for policies</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ephemeral-living">Benjamin Lupton’s Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>What concerns me about Google and Facebook</h3><p>Google and Facebook have more information on its users than governments do. They also have more users than any single government has citizens. People are afraid of governments but not these companies that have more citizens, more information, and more attention than governments do.</p><p>One can find out one’s personality and even <a href="http://oursocialtimes.com/how-to-identify-psychopaths-on-twitter/">personality disorders from analysing public tweets</a>. Facebook can know when you have <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/10643858/Facebook-knows-when-youre-about-to-start-a-relationship.html">begun a relationship before you tell anyone</a> and the same goes for <a href="http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/facebook-knows-a-break-up-is-coming-before-you-do/news-story/102aee86d741df11b1dab993314535e5">breaking up</a>. All control your attention. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_%28media%29">echo chamber</a> environment is damaging enough, with their knowledge about you creating filter bubbles reinforcing ideas you believe in (ideas that may be false) and surpressing ones you don’t (ideas that may be true), furthering social divides.</p><p>The abundance of identifiable personal information they can analyse requires a lot of trust that it won’t be abused, trust that we don’t even place in our own governments — for such things as advertising (get a gmail email or facebook message from a friend suggesting dishwashers because yours is broken, you will probably get an advert about it at some point) — or political gains, such as recommending different videos on your youtube or facebook homepage, ones you never subscribed to. Or even them knowing you may be a 20-something male affects what you see <a href="https://medium.com/ephemeral-living/the-news-private-vs-tracked-8b731374fc84">to the detriment of quality.</a></p><p>It is concerning enough that my own Australian government has information on me. It is even more concerning that from the Snowden revelations that the USA government collects all my interactions with a USA company. It is even more concerning that any data that Google or Facebook intercepts about me, be it even ones I did not upload, such as a photo of me uploaded to Facebook, is then analysed for their benefit and not mine — hence why Stallman calls social networks, surveillance networks. Eric Schimdt, a director and previous CEO of Google said that all it takes them is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100815042507/http://www.thinq.co.uk:80/2010/8/5/no-anonymity-future-web-says-google-ceo/">14 photos</a> of your face to identify you going forward forever, even using images not contributed to Google. <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/684366/pentagon-to-establish-defense-innovation-advisory-board">Google and other USA tech companies also advise the USA department of defence</a>, luckily not on military technology — although who knows, as if they did that would be top secret, just like their giving of data to the NSA was. They also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Google">alter their content</a> to please the governments of the markets they enter.</p><p>They are companies that want to mine all the data they can about you, for whatever purposes they see fit. Purposes that may be in your interests, and purposes that may be in <em>their</em> interests. There are purposes that are public, and purposes that are secret and internal. Two examples of secret and against you: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/facebook-apologizes_n_5922040">Facebook manipulated content to test the effects on the long-term emotions of their audience</a>. <a href="https://epic.org/privacy/ftc/google/5_19_10_Markey_Barton_FTC_re_Google_WiFi.pdf">Google used their Street View vehicles to mine local WiFi details and data</a>, to do more accurate geolocation while collecting and storing wifi data on unsecured networks.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google">Google</a> are companies that believe privacy is an archaic nuisance, that the future is complete and utter transparency. Already companies know more about you, than you know about yourself — because you don’t know the private lives of those around you, but they do, nor do you really know what your own “self” really means without psychological assistance, but they do. This point will only grow to become more concerning, as increasing amounts of public and private data get mined and correlated, and then <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/personality-insights.html">analysed</a> <a href="http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/tone-analyzer.html">in</a> <a href="http://oursocialtimes.com/how-to-identify-psychopaths-on-twitter/">ever</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_fBYROA7Hk&amp;index=25&amp;list=PLYVl5EnzwqsRPSBKIn6qMatpxWopxs1eB">more</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2w23Zc-Zfs&amp;index=26&amp;list=PLYVl5EnzwqsRPSBKIn6qMatpxWopxs1eB">intelligent</a> ways, the <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/node/1037">concerns</a> of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0NZ9aixNEY">insights</a> will <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/">increase</a> too.</p><p>None of this is conspiracy, all of this is actions and public statements made by the companies.</p><p>None of it however are things I want anything to do with.</p><p>If I could pick the future, it would not be a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/">Wall-E</a> future (a future that is very much a Google and Facebook future) where advertisements and technology completely shelters (unknowingly enslaves) our attention in a safety bubble removing our humanity. Nor a Skynet or Matrix future where technology is exploited for collective gain over the individual. Instead the most appealing compromise seems to be a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/">Her</a> future (a future that is very Apple-esque) where technology progresses in the interest of the individual.</p><p>Instead I use products and companies that help facilitate what is to me a better future, one where the individual still maintains power over their most valuable asset, their data, mitigating exploitation from collective misuse.</p><p>The products I’ve found best that have a balance of privacy and usability, are <a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple</a> products (data is only mined at your approval and done in ways that generally cannot be linked back to you — e.g. facial recognition happens completely anonymously and for the most part, locally), <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> for search (surprisingly it is better than Google for me as it doesn’t echo chamber me), and <a href="https://wire.com">Wire</a> and <a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a> for messaging. <a href="https://protonmail.com">ProtonMail</a> for email is also great.</p><p>—</p><p>This was Part 2 covering “why data mining scares me” in my series on technology and privacy. <a href="https://medium.com/p/303df2011df0">Part 1 covering “how Google mines your private data” can be found here.</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=10801cd4c934" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/ephemeral-living/google-and-facebook-privacy-concerns-10801cd4c934">Google and Facebook Privacy Concerns</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ephemeral-living">Benjamin Lupton’s Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good article Caleb—a valuable take on some of the forces that drive us.</p><p>In addition, I’ll add the following from my own research, learnings and experience, which should complement what you’ve written.</p><h4><strong>Values.</strong></h4><p>In 2010, I attended a series of Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) seminars by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherhoward">Christopher Howard</a> (essentially the Tony Robbins of Oceania), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/duanealley">Duane Alley</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnnie-cass-3b21053">Johnnie Cass</a>. In one called Billionaire Bootcamp lead by Duane, where the goal was to identify your own value system, study the values of Billionaires, then rearchitect your values based on the study. On the 3rd or 4th day of the 5 day training, they put you through a hypnotic induction to tear down your old values and consequently to me at least, my “self”. And on the 4th or 5th day of the training, you then insert your new value system.</p><p>As we may know, our values drive nearly everything about us, our beliefs, our worldview, our actions, and our results. Those 24–48 hours of being completely torn down and laid bare were the most terrifying of my life. It made me question everything. That who I was was not fixed. That anyone, including me, is ever-changing. <strong>Who are we, if not our values???</strong> It’ll be a while until the science of consciousness can verify any answer of this.</p><p>Normally one’s values change over many years—relationship and career changes, growing older, etc—or when a significant traumatic event occurs in someone’s life—cancer, divorce, death of a loved one, etc.</p><p>Having this experience, then realising that one can take control of their own “self”, and let it be more than just circumstantial, was liberating—and for those days, terrifying while I struggled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death">ego death</a>.</p><h4><strong>Presence.</strong></h4><p>In 2013, I discovered <a href="http://balupton.com/amazon/0452289963">Eckhart Tolle</a> as well as the book series <a href="http://balupton.com/amazon/0399142789">Conversations with God</a>, which brought the eastern style of eliminating ego to me, bringing the notion of detachment / cognitive awareness / mindfulness / whatever label one wishes to use, into my everyday life, which was especially great in emotionally intense situations—which when practiced would allow me to gain control of my internal situation and consequently my actions, by letting myself stay calm and based instead of the usual emotionally reactive.</p><p>For seculars, <a href="https://balupton.com/amazon/1451636024">Sam Harris’s book Waking Up has you covered.</a></p><h4><strong>State.</strong></h4><p>During my NLP and Pickup Artistry days, we were also taught the concept of state. State comprising of our body language, our thoughts, and our emotions. As we go about our day to day, those three components are usually at the whim of our circumstances, with two notable exceptions.</p><p>At the control of ourselves—for instance; to feel sad, sit forward head in hands and start thinking negative thoughts, you will begin to feel sad; to feel happy, sit straight up, lift your chest and head to the sky with your arms extended to expose your naval as much as your stretching makes possible, while smiling a big smile and thinking happy thoughts.</p><p>As these body language cues are so naturally ingrained within us, often the body language change alone is all that is required to shift the other two state components—even in other people… which brings us to</p><p>At the whim of others—it should be obvious that our body language affects others, that is the role of empathy and situational awareness, if someone is coming at us with a knife then running is more appropriate than hugging. This can be extended and furthered by the notion of what some name Archetypical Poses (every NLP practitioner names these something else, and I’m yet to find what their official name is), which included these poses:</p><ol><li>Joking Pose: Laughing smile, hands in that egyptian dance pose; used to undertone what you say as if it was a joke</li><li>Power Pose: Hand on hip, one leg in front, hand pointing at another, stern look, strong pose; used to command respect and focus from another—used by presentors to wake the audience up after a boring part, or to gain attention for a follow up call to action</li><li>Begging Pose: Arms outstretched to waist level aligned with your hips, palms to the sky; used to influence someone’s pity</li><li>Safety Pose: Arms folded; used to protect vital organs communicating distrust—avoid this pose, unless cold, in which case, put arms underneath armpits, to diminish the threatening nature of it</li><li>Thinking Pose: One hand on chin, elbow resting on other folded arm; used to show consideration, to take something seriously—valuable when wanting others to consider a point they may not otherwise consider</li><li>Friendly Pose: Hands just behind your hips, palms towards them, exposing your naval, big smile, optionally followed with hug or hand shake; used to expose vital organs communicating trust and approachability — one of the most valuable gestures to do when greeting new people</li></ol><p>Here is a NLP practitioner explaining and using some of them:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSOSTfOJOR4">NLP &amp; Presentation Skills — The Satir Categories (Part 1/2)—Duration: 4:39</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J0ZsrVnBZU">NLP &amp; Presentation Skills—The Satir Categories (Part 2/2)—Duration: 8:41</a></li><li>and in action<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoPRL60cA70"> NLP in Presenting — 2. Merlin &amp; Arthur. Full version — Duration: 22:28</a></li></ul><h4>Chemicals.</h4><p>In 2015, trying to understand how love works. I discovered several things relating to chemicals, and their complete power on us. A lot more power than many would ever like to accept. Heck, the research by <a href="http://www.helenfisher.com">Dr. Helen Fisher</a> even shows our personality is predictable from the chemicals within us.</p><p>In love, <a href="http://www.mcmanweb.com/love_lust.html">there are three main drivers</a>:</p><ol><li>Dopamine—the initial reward system, drives any action—male seeing a pretty girl, dopamine hit—novel information, dopamine hit—fat, sugar, salt dopamine hit—sex massive dopamine hit. Every habit is formed via the establishment of a reward pathway of dopamine towards it, and broken by the abstinence from that pathway weakening it.</li><li>Oxytocin—released any time bonding is occuring, especially touch — every handshake, every hug, every caress, every kiss, releases more and more oxytocin to bond us to that person. The motherly bond is formed through natural births causing the release of her entire oxytocin reserves. Cupid’s arrow is an oxytocin syringe.</li><li>Vasopressin—cements 2+ years into a relationship, used for long-term attachment, what we have with our family, provides the feeling of obligation to that person. Oxytocin will probably start fading around this time too, unless a child comes into the picture.</li></ol><p>In solo masturbation, <a href="http://yourbrainonporn.com">be wary</a>:</p><ol><li>Normally with orgasm you get a large release of oxytocin for bonding with the partner and prolactin for the refractory period. However with solo masturbation, as there is no one to bond to, no oxytocin for bonding is released, only prolactin for isolation is—magnifying the isolating feelings of prolactin over time.</li><li>Minutes of porn use in males causes their dopamine receptors to go crazy without even touching themselves yet. This is driven by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect">Coolidge Effect</a>.</li></ol><p>As a side note, this research was a large factor in what led me from my move away from liberal values to conservative values. Our biology doesn’t reward liberal values too much, much in the same way that failing the marshmellow test for immediate gratification doesn’t promote long-term success.</p><p>To build better pathways in myself and decrease bad ones, I started researching ways in which I can cause the release of such things. The main ways I found are:</p><ol><li>Accomplishing any goal, big or small releases dopamine. Any time we check something off a list, especially a physical one, we get dopamine. If we consistently and routinely accomplish goals around a particular task, then doing that task itself will start releasing dopamine, as a positive submodality is formed.</li><li>Abstaining from a goal or not accomplishing a goal, will hinder dopamine and may even release deterrent hormones. Every time we fail at finishing a task, we strengthen a negative submodality to deter us from that goal.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runner%27s_high">Runner’s High</a>. Around 45 minutes into an aerobic activity, that is gradually built up, one will start to get a flood of endorphins, including some of the ones used in rewards and love. Compounding this with the other two points will assist in the consistent release of runners high providing you hit your activity goals each time you commence your run.</li></ol><p>If you know others, let me know! Would be cool to setup a sort of ad-hock bio/hormone/chemical hacking group through hopefully natural (non-drug-induced) actions.</p><h4>Cognitive Dissonance.</h4><p>The actual reason I started writing this response, is this item. As there are a lot of parallels with Frued’s ego notions, and the study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">Cognitive Dissonance</a>.</p><p>Cognitive dissonance can be thought of as the wrestling of these three selves:</p><ul><li>the ideal self, who we wish to be</li><li>the actual self, who we consider ourselves to be</li><li>the should self, who we consider we should be</li></ul><p>At times in our life, we will be presented with information or a circumstance that challenges our foundations, moving one of our selves away from the others. In circumstances like this, based on how deep the challange is, or rather how far the distance that the conflicting self has moved away from the others, it will cause us proportionate distress, as it threatens the consistency of our integrity, world view, and belief system. The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815.Influence">Influence</a> concurs, outlining that consistency is one of our most needed treasures to staying sane, even to the point of exploitation.</p><p>So what is an example. Let’s say you are depressed, you could have a situation like this:</p><blockquote>the ideal self is far away from your actual self</blockquote><p>You can either drag down the ideal self to meet your low perception of your should self, or you can drag up your actual self through effort and hard work to meet your ideal self.</p><p>Which action makes sense in that situation, depends on where your should self also is. If your should self is also where your actual self is, then perhaps your ideals need changing, such as the value change system I outlined earlier, as they may go against preconceived false or inherently true aspects of your worldview. If your should self is where your ideal self is, then perhaps your actual self either needs to accept one’s lot in the world, that if your voicebox was lost to cancer, your dreams of and business of being a singing superstar are now shattered, then your ideal and should self need to come down to reality — or if you still have a voicebox, and want to be a singer, and feel you should be a singer, but are too lazy to go to practice, maybe you should practice, as the search for consistency and the process of cognitive dissonance will resolve that for you by dragging down the other two and accepting yourself as a lazy fuck with lesser ideals and lesser expectations.</p><h4>Conclusion.</h4><p>Knowing these things, have empowered me to take a lot more control over my everyday life and goals. Knowing the ego is illusionary, provided me with these two risks over the years, that now I am keenly aware of:</p><ol><li>Thinking that ego death is permanent—ego is made up, but still is unavoidably inherent and bound to the human experience—despite this, one can learn to accept it, and to work with it, by watching and mediating its fluctuations through states of dissonance with mindfulness and journalling, and using the tools of state and chemical hacking, will assist this powerful part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1wg1DNHbNU">human spiritual experience</a></li><li>Falling into nihilism or moral relativism—just because our egos / selves / values are illusions that can change at a whim of circumstance or even through deliberated effort, does not mean that all is meaningless. One may inevitably be thrown into the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism">Absurdism</a> to rectify this understanding in their worldview—but may instead find themselves falling in and out of Absurdism to Nihilism to Depression again and again. I would suggest the works and talks of <a href="https://www.samharris.org">Sam Harris</a> and <a href="http://jordanbpeterson.com">Jordan Peterson</a> for rectifying this. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AgatanFoundation">Agatan Foundation</a> is also a good resource.</li></ol><p>Eventually I hope to turn these learnings and other learnings into a choreographed book if there is enough interest.
